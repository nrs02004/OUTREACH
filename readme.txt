In this folder are all the scripts needed to do the sample size calculations/simulations.

The "entry point" for the scripts to generate the simulation results is "script.R". This script loads in "scenarios.R", "functions.R", and "gen_output.R", to run the simulations and generate output used in creating plots.

"functions.R" contains all the functions used in running the simulations
"scenarios.R" gives parameters for the different scenarios that we simulate under
"gen_output.R" generates csv files and rdata files once all simulations are run. Output is written to the "saved_files/" folder

To generate the output used in the slides (that we didn't end up using for design day), one can run the script "gen_figs_for_slides.R". (This should likely be run line-by-line rather than sourced, as there are some values that one may want to change). Figures generated by this are saved in the "saved_files/" folder

"Documents/SS_calc.Rmd" is an R markdown document that takes the simulation output generated by "script.R" and creates an RMD document.

All other files (excluding this "readme.txt") are output from the above (based on my run of "script.R", "gen_figs_for_slides.R" and "Documents/SS_calc.Rmd"). They will be regenerated if you rerun that code. Running "script.R" took me about 1 day on my MacBook Pro (with only 30 simulations per scenario)
